# need-a-password

## Description

An application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they've selected. 

- My goal for working on this project was to develop an application that allows employees to generate random passwords based on parameters they have chosen or have not chosen.
- Creating a password generator will allow me to demonstrate my basic html, CSS, and javascript connection skills while allowing an employee to access sensitive data on a website with a password that gives an adequate level of security.
- This assignment taught me an array ( ;) ) of web development abilities. In Javascript, I learned how to define variables that can be called in functions and displayed on a website adjacent to each other. I learned how to utilize an addEventListener to define functions that will be triggered when a specific event occurs, such as when the user hits the generate password button and a series of curated symbol and number patterns appear. I also learned how to utilize an array to hold several values in a single variable, as well as how to manipulate and concatenate the array to make prompts that ask questions about what the user wants in their randomized password.
